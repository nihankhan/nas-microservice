# Project Name: NAS Microservices Ecosystem

![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

The NAS Microservices Ecosystem is a scalable and modular solution for managing network-attached storage (NAS) resources. It is designed to provide flexible authentication, storage management, file operations, and a user-friendly dashboard through a set of microservices. This README file provides an overview of the project structure, how to get started, and additional details about each component.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple microservices, each responsible for specific functionalities:

- **auth-service**: Manages user authentication.
- **storage-service**: Handles storage resource management.
- **file-service**: Provides file and directory operations.
- **api-gateway**: Routes and proxies requests to appropriate microservices.
- **dashboard-service**: Offers a web-based dashboard for users to interact with NAS resources.
- **common**: Contains shared code and utilities used across microservices.
- **config**: Stores configuration files for the entire ecosystem.
- **web**: Houses static files and templates for the frontend.
- **Makefile**: Defines project-related tasks.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **Dockerfile**: Optional Dockerfile for containerization.
- **README.md**: This file, providing project documentation.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the NAS Microservices Ecosystem up and running:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nas-microservice.git
   cd nas-microservice
   ```

2. **Configuration**: Update the configuration files in the `config` directory to match your environment and requirements.

3. **Build Microservices**: Build each microservice using the provided `Makefile`. For example:

   ```bash
   make build-auth-service
   make build-storage-service
   make build-file-service
   # Repeat for other microservices as needed
   ```

4. **Run Microservices**: Start each microservice using the built binary. For example:

   ```bash
   ./auth-service/cmd/main
   ./storage-service/cmd/main
   ./file-service/cmd/main
   # Repeat for other microservices as needed
   ```

5. **Start the API Gateway**: Run the API gateway to route requests:

   ```bash
   ./api-gateway/cmd/main
   ```

6. **Launch the Dashboard**: Start the dashboard service for a user-friendly web interface:

   ```bash
   ./dashboard-service/cmd/main
   ```

7. **Access the Dashboard**: Open a web browser and navigate to the dashboard at `http://localhost:8080` (or as configured).
